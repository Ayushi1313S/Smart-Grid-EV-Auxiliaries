# Smart-Grid-EV-Auxiliaries

This repository consists of a MATLAB Simulink model used for the writing phase of a research paper that I submitted for its reviews in BCIPECH-2022. The model is based on describing the concept of V2G Technology that is going to takeover the EV & Power System R&D in future years to minimize losses and electricity regulation-based cost associated issues.  

It was a group project with Ajeet101KR, and hence, this repository is a result of teamwork.
